If you use any third party application, it wont have base effect on query performance. Important to understand deadlocks. Framework limitations has to be dealt to understand issue further. – Ven",

similar like for android but very minor changes are there

function viewLinkpdf(filepath) {
        var url = (filepath.match('http')) ? filepath : 'http://' + filepath;
        window.open(encodeURI('https://docs.google.com/gview?embedded=true&url='+url), '_blank', 'location=no,EnableViewPortScale=yes');

        var fileName = filename.split('.').pop();
        if (fileName == 'pdf')
        {
            viewLinkpdf(filename)
        }
        else 
        {
            viewLink(filename)
        }
    }
    function viewLink(filepath) {
        var url = (filepath.match('http')) ? filepath : 'http://' + filepath;
        var options = {
            location: 'no',
            clearcache: 'yes',
            toolbar: 'no'
        };
        $cordovaInAppBrowser.open(url, '_blank', options)
        .then(function (event) {
            // success
        })
        .catch(function (event) {
            // error
        });
    }
i place both the code here might be its repeated catch it which you want. I hope this will help you.
